Travel time to the nearest starbase? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Computer, belay that order. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.
